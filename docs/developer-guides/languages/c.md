:::warning
Hayride specific bindings for C are under development. Keep an eye on the [hayride bindings repository](https://github.com/hayride-dev/bindings) for ongoing updates.

The Hayride bindings are only designed to aid in the development process, **they are not required**. 

If you are interested in using C without official hayride bindings, please refer to the [C language guide](https://component-model.bytecodealliance.org/language-support/c.html) for developing WebAssembly components.
